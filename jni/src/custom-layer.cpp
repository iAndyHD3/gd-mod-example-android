      in cocos, anchor points are between 0 and 1, with (0, 0) being the
      bottom left corner. By default the anchor is at (0.5, 0.5), meaning
      its at the center of the node. Since we have not changed the position
      of the sprite, it's still at its default position (0, 0), so setting the
      anchor to the bottom right corner will make the sprite be at the center
      of the screen, which is where we want it.
      You could also do this by setting the position to half of the window size,
      however i find this solution more neat.
